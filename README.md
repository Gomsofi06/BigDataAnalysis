# Big Data Analysis Project (24/25)

Project for the Big Data Analysis course of the Master in Data Science at the NOVA IMS Faculty, Lisbon

Made in collaboration between **Sofia Gomes**, **Marta Boavida**, **David Casc√£o**, **Jan-Louis Schneider** and **Jorge Cordeiro**

## Objective of the Project:
Application of Big Data techniques to detect epileptic seizures in pediatric patients. Classify brain activity into three states: normal, pre-seizure, and seizure.

## Parts of the project:
1. Data Exploration, Analysis and Pre-processing
2. Modeling
3. Report

## Conclusions:
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance, especially in handling imbalanced data and partially identifying seizure activity.
